    "# 🏈 Predicting Blitzes Using Pre-Snap Behavior\n",

    "## Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Blitzing is one of the most aggressive and high-risk strategies in football. When executed well, it can disrupt an offensive drive by forcing the quarterback into rushed decisions; when misread or mistimed, it can leave the defense vulnerable to big plays. Offensive coaches and quarterbacks spend countless hours studying pre-snap cues to anticipate incoming blitzes, while defenses work just as hard to disguise them through subtle shifts, delayed rushes, and simulated pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to bring analytics into this equation by predicting whether a defense will blitz, using only pre-snap player tracking data from the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 dataset. By extracting features such as player positioning, movement trends, alignment depth, and formation structure, we seek to develop machine learning models that systematically classify plays as blitz or non-blitz scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "A successful model would not only help identify the most telling pre-snap indicators of pressure but also provide a practical tool for offensive strategists to better anticipate and counter defensive blitzes, enhancing both game preparation and real-time decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure\n",

    "Our data can be downloaded from the 2025 Big Data Bowl on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/data)  \n",
    "or using the Kaggle API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "kaggle competitions download -c nfl-big-data-bowl-2025\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- Download the dataset and unzip the file `nfl-big-data-bowl-2025.zip`.\n",
    "- The datasets will be saved in a `\\nfl-big-data-bowl-2025` directory within the project repo.\n",
    "- Ensure that this directory is listed in your `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing large data files to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's check that the data has been downloaded correctly:"
