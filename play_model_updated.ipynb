    "## Final Model Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is a high-level overview of the pipeline. Continue scrolling to see a basic implementation with more detail on assumptions and design choices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final model, we will adopt an RNN architecture. While some elements (like the hyperparameters, specific architecture, and feature selection) will be determined as we iterate, we will begin with a baseline model and then iteratively improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will iterate through the following approaches:\n",
    "1. **Baseline RNN**: Feed through sequences of N rows of data. Each row corresponds to one play, and sequence is made up of N consecutive plays. The final play is the target -- the model must predict whether or not a blitz occurred in the final play.\n",
    "2. **Frame-by-Frame RNN:** Feed through sequences of N rows of data. Each row corresponds to one frame of a single play. The final frame is the target -- the model must predict whether or not a blitz occurred within this play. \n",
    "3. **Mixture of Both:** Run both types of RNN. Combine the hidden states before a MLP head predicts the final blitz / no blitz output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Pipeline will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PREPROCESSING**\n",
    "   1. One hot encode categorical variables (teams, positions, formations)\n",
    "   2. Drop columns that are un-usable.\n",
    "   3. Create sequences, using a sliding window. Write a function for creating sequences -- we want the sliding window size to be flexible (we may want to change this later)\n",
    "2. **MODELING**\n",
    "   1. Define the architecture; the input should be N * (sequence length) * (number of features)\n",
    "   2. Work with some sort of RNN units -- either RNN, GRU, or LSTM\n",
    "   3. Output of final dense layer should be one logits with sigmoid activation for binary classification.\n",
    "   4. We will minimize the binary cross-entropy loss -- this is the most logical approach, as we have chosen to have 1 logit.\n",
    "3. **TRAINING**\n",
    "   1. Train the model on the training data. Log loss, accuracy, and validation accuracy\n",
    "   2. Plot training results over each epoch"
